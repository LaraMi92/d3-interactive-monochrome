  a library to manipulate the DOM based on data so that you can re-render HTML & SVG elements on the page

  select() & selectAll() => both select and manipulate elements (through HTML tags or CSS selectors)

```js

Let's say our HTML only consists of a div.

d3.select('div')
  .selectAll('p')

//will first select the 'div' element in the DOM, and all the 'p' elements within the div

d3.select('div')
  .selectAll('p')
  .data()

//now we're passing data that will be bound to our previously selected paragraphs. Data refers to an array.

d3.select('div')
  .selectAll('p')
  .data([1, 2, 3])
  .enter()

//now, by passing 'enter()', we're basically telling d3 to tell us if there is any missing element, regarding the data we're trying to pass.
//In our case, we're missing 3 paragraphs, because we have 3 items in our array.

d3.select('div')
  .selectAll('p')
  .data([1, 2, 3])
  .enter()
  .append('p')

//So by appending 'p' to enter, we're creating the missing paragraphs that will allow to show the data we passed

d3.select('div')
  .selectAll('p')
  .data([1, 2, 3])
  .enter()
  .append('p')
  .text(data => data)

//to render text, we can now pass a function, that will take our data as argument. So we can dynamically render any text. In our case, "1", "2", "3".

Scale package.
xAxis = scaleBand().domain([]).rangeRound([])
yAxis = scaleLinear().domain([]).range()

```
